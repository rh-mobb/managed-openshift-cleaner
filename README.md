# Summary

The repo holds code that may be used to clean non-production Managed OpenShift clusters.  It 
includes examples of how you may run it in your environment.  This is used internally by the 
MOBB team as a way to cut down on costs for our own environments.

> **CAUTION:** the code in this repository is destructive.  Please be sure of what you 
are doing before implementation in your own environment.
